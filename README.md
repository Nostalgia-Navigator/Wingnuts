# Wingnuts: Temporal Navigator

Here is the full Windows version of Wingnuts: Temporal Navigator. This repository also includes decompiled sprites (which can be opened in TiledGGD) and sounds (which are in WAV format)

Since Freeverse, Inc is dead and barely anyone remembers Wingnuts: Temporal Navigator these days, I'll keep these files public.
