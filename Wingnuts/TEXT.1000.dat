<c0><fC>Situation<c1><i2>Baron von Schtopwatch has just announced to the world that he must be paid 100 billion dollars in cash, (and given a complete set of beanie babies including the retired, yet adorable, Squealer the Pig), or he will unleash his Temporal Robotic Airforce on humanity!<c1><i2>Unlike the half-dozen other psychos who have made this same threat over the years, it seems that Herr Schtopwatch might actually HAVE a Temporal Robotic Airforce. (Uh-Oh).<c1><i2>That's why the world has called on you. Stationed aboard the USS Flotsam aircraft carrier, you and your WingNuts team of Pilots, Scientists, and Latin Dance Instructors had been investigating mysterious airplane disappearances in the area known as the Bermuda Triangle.<c1><i2>Satellite photos have just revealed a horde of what looks to be WWI era aircraft circling to the north of you. If the Baron HAS managed to perfect a Temporal Sifter and begun to steal aircraft from the past... well, then he's a drooling moron because those bi-planes are no match for modern jets! But even a moron will eventually wise-up to the fact that a Temporal Sifter can grab planes from the future as well as the past. If von Schtopwatch manages to get advanced aircraft, and if his robot pilots are any good, you and the world could be in a whole mess of trouble.<c1><i2>You order the Flotsam north, order your Jet fueled, and cancel your afternoon Rhumba lesson.  Looks like you have a job to do, WingNut!
