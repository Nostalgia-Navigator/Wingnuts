<c0><fC>Hints and Tips<c1><i2>Try to destroy an enemy formation as quickly as possible for a large bonus score.  If you take a bit more time you will get a reduced bonus.  If you take too long you get nothing.  The bonus depends on the level you're at and the number of aircraft in the formation.<c1><i2>As you destroy aircraft in a formation, one of them will probably suddenly veer off and become independent.  It is then no longer part of the formation and need not be destroyed immediately to collect the bonus.  The rogue pilot's aircraft will be faster and more maneuverable and may try to actively hunt you down or possibly run away.<c1><i2>For greatest effectiveness, you need to be closer to the boss to do more damage with your weapons.  If your bullets are too far away when they hit their damage is decreased.<c1><i2>For the frame-rate junkies out there, hit Tab to toggle a display of the current frame rate, as well as the minimum and maximum rates so far, and the total number of frames.<c1><i2>Most dialog screens have the Return key mapped to "Okay" and Escape mapped to "Cancel", if appropriate.  On the main screen hit Return at any time to start a new game quickly.WingNuts:  Temporal Navigator is Copyright (c) 2001-2002 by Freeverse Software.
