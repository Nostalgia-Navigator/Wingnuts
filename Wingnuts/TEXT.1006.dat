<c0><fC>Saving a Game<c1><i2>At the end of each level, when the bonus screen is shown, you have the option to click on "Save Game" in order to save the game in the current state.  Later on, you can reload this same game and start playing again where you left off.  Battling the Baron is a long-term proposition for skilled pilots, so you need not fight the Baron in one long session.  After all, you may want to get up and stretch, go to work or school or do some homework or even eat something.<c0><fC>Loading a Game<c1><i2>Select "Options..." and then "Load Game" to load a previously saved game.  You can also delete games you have no need for.  As you select a game in the list some important statistics of the game are shown at the bottom to help you decide if the game is really the one you want to load.  The game will stay in the list as long as you want, and will not be deleted just because you restarted it.  A definite plus if you are defeated immediately and want to restart right away.<c0><fC>Top Aces<c1><i2>You can select "Options..." and then "Top Aces" to show the high score list.  As you hover the mouse over each of the entries the bottom of the screen will show some of the statistics of the game, including levels played, and numbers of enemies destroyed.
