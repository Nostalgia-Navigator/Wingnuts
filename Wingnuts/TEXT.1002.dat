<c0><fC>Fuel<c1><i2>If your fuel goes below a quarter tank, a tanker aircraft will appear on the radar.  Fly to it and follow behind it.  When you get close a circle will tell you where you need to put the nose of your aircraft.  As soon as the automated alignment system of the tanker activates, release your control and fueling will start.  If you need to break off prematurely, just turn left or right and fueling will stop.  You are automatically disconnected when your tank is filled.<c0><fC>Shields<c1><i2>Obviously, your ship also has limited shield power.  You can tell how much shields you have remaining from the circular shield indicators to the right of the screen, as well as the small bar chart indicating the exact shield power.  You can increase the shield power by collecting an extra shield goody.  You will also get a small shield boost when you finish the level.  The Baron's threat is so great that you cannot afford to sit in the hangar long enough to have your shields boosted to full capacity.<c0><fC>Time<c1><i2>There is a set amount of time budgeted for you to complete each level.  Completion of the level before this time runs out will result in extra bonus points being awarded.
