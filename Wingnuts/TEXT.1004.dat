<c0><fC>Main Weapon<c1><i2>At your disposal you have your main gun which is used to fire at air units, such as aircraft, helicopters and blimps.  Your tanker is luckily impervious to your guns.  However, your bullets will destroy goodies, so watch out.  They can take one hit without exploding, but a second hit will destroy them.  There are weapon upgrade goodies to be had in later levels which increase the number and effectiveness of your weapon.  When your ship is destroyed the replacement ship's weapons will be degraded, but at higher levels there is a minimum weapon standard that is maintained so you are not completely helpless.<c0><fC>Bombs<c1><i2>You also have an unlimited number of bombs at your disposal.  However, to begin you can only drop a single bomb at a time.  As you collect extra bomb goodies, your ability to drop multiple bombs at a time will increase.  This is very important in later levels, so do not destroy the extra bomb goodies if at all possible.<c0><fC>Missiles<c1><i2>At later levels you are outfitted with heat-seeking missiles.  Point your ship towards your target and when you fire the missile an indicator will be shown around the targeted unit.  The heads-up display in the top right will also show if the missile is locked on.  As the levels progress these become more maneuverable and deadly.  They can be used to destroy aircraft, blimps, helicopters, bosses and even floating air mines.  However, you have a limited supply, so don't squander them.  There are extra missile goodies floating here and there which give you a few extra missiles.  The number of missiles remaining is shown in the area to the right of the screen.
